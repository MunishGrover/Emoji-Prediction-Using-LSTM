# Emoji-Prediction-Using-LSTM
## Description
The project aims to analyze text and predict the emoji related to text using LSTM.The model is using early stopping thus the best model is formed and model is saved as best_model.h5
## Running
<br>
To run the project you need to download a file glove.6B.50d.txt
<br> make a folder of dataset and download two files
